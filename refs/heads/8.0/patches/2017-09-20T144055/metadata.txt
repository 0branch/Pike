• Search.Database.MySQL: Added some optional consistency checks.

Defining SEARCH_DB_CONSISTENCY_CHECKS will now cause the module
to perform some extra SQL queries to make sure that the modified
entries are consistent.

• Search.Database.MySQL: Fixed truncation of word_hit.hits.

word_hit.hits should now lose its padding on the last write.

Also some related code cleanup.
