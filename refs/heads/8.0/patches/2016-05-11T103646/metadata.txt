Multiple fixes:

  * __builtin.Nettle.Hash [HMAC]: Implement init().
    
    The init() function in the HMAC State object now actually works
    as documented.

  * Implemented HMAC jwa with a little less code.

  * Documentation [__builtin.Nettle.Sign]: Improved JOSE doc.

  * __builtin.Nettle.MAC: Added support for HMAC-based JWS signatures.

  * __builtin.Nettle.Hash [HMAC]: Somewhat stricter type for `jwa().
    
    Also adds some documentation.

  * Nettle: Added __builtin.Nettle.AE.
    
    This is Authenticated Encryption without Authenticated Data.

  * Crypto.AE: Added class.

  * Crypto.None: Added the plaintext algorithm.

  * __builtin.Nettle.MAC: Fixed some warnings.

  * release number bumped to 8.0.238 by export.pike
