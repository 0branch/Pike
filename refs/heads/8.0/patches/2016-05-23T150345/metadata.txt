Multiple fixes:

  * Filesystem.Monitor: Potential fix for [bug 7684].
    
    Avoid recursive mutex locks from destroy() by only locking
    on explicit destruct().

  * Added WebSocket ports to the known port numbers.

  * Added client mode for WebSocket module.

  * Better typing in functionn signatures.
