â€¢ Search.Database.MySQL: Fixed bugs in store_to_db().

Work around for MySQL/MariaDB interpreting

  INSERT('ABC', 3, 3, 'DEF')

as equivalent to just 'ABC' (and NOT 'ABCDEF').

Note that

  INSERT('ABCX', 3, 3, 'DEF')

does result in 'ABCDEF'.

Also some code clean up to reduce the number of special cases.
