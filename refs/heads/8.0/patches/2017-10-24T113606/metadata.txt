Multiple fixes:

• Search.Utils: Updated debug output indentation to Roxen 6.1 conventions.

• Filesystem.Monitor: Improved handling of filtered paths.

Fixes an indexing the null value error when paths are filtered.

• Standards.IIM: Disabled debug message.

Disabled output of "Unknown segment marker:"' since it spams the log.

• Filesystem.Monitor: Fixed bug in Monitor()->update().

To check if the class was initialized, code looked at the variable "next_poll", this
caused the monitor to be polled every second if a subclass later set "next_poll" to 0.
