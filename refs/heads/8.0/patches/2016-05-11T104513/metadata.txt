Multiple fixes:

  * release number bumped to 8.0.243 by export.pike

  * Parser.RCS: Add optional max_revisions parameter to the API.

  * Parser.RCS: Bugfix in create().

  * Parser.RCS: Added feature detection constant "max_revisions_supported".

  * Filesystem.Monitor: Improved error handling somewhat.
    
    Errors were hidden in some cases.

  * Filexyxtem.Monitor: Got rid of update_monitor().
    
    The function didn't work, and if it had worked it would've messed
    with the internal state of monitors and caused stuff to break.

  * Filesystem.Monitor: Improved FILESYSTEM_MONITOR_DEBUG diagnostics.

  * Filesystem.Monitor: Don't propagate all errors.
    
    Errors thrown by check() on deletion could cause other deletion
    notifications to be lost, as the errors were rethrown before
    the rest of the notifications were handled.
    
    Those errors are now instead sent directly to the master.
