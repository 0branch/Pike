Multiple fixes:

  * release number bumped to 8.0.235 by export.pike

  * cpp: correctly handle unterminated strings in macro arguments
    
    Previously, when passing an unterminated string as an argument to a
    macro with 'stringify'-flag, the code would read past the end of the
    string. This could result in out of bounds memory access.

  * __builtin.Nettle.Hash [HMAC]: Implement init().
    
    The init() function in the HMAC State object now actually works
    as documented.

  * release number bumped to 8.0.236 by export.pike

  * release number bumped to 8.0.237 by export.pike

  * Implemented HMAC jwa with a little less code.

  * Documentation [__builtin.Nettle.Sign]: Improved JOSE doc.

  * __builtin.Nettle.MAC: Added support for HMAC-based JWS signatures.

  * __builtin.Nettle.Hash [HMAC]: Somewhat stricter type for `jwa().
    
    Also adds some documentation.

  * Nettle: Added __builtin.Nettle.AE.
    
    This is Authenticated Encryption without Authenticated Data.

  * Crypto.AE: Added class.

  * Crypto.None: Added the plaintext algorithm.

  * __builtin.Nettle.MAC: Fixed some warnings.

  * More CHANGES.

  * release number bumped to 8.0.238 by export.pike

  * release number bumped to 8.0.239 by export.pike

  * Don't pretend jwa is a variable, to be consistent with name(), digest_size() etc.

  * Noted some SSL fixes.

  * CHANGES: Added note about JOSE.

  * release number bumped to 8.0.240 by export.pike

  * release number bumped to 8.0.241 by export.pike
