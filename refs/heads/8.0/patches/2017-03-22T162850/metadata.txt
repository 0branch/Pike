Multiple fixes:

• Web: Added {en,de}code_jws().

These simplify handling of JWSes other than JWTs.

• Web.decode_jwk: Added support for decoding of symmetric keys.

Decoding of JWK encoded keys for SHA256/HMAC, etc is now supported.

Also adds some convenience variants.

• Protocols.HTTP.Query: Don't hang in if we are unable to open a socket.

• Updated timezone data to 2017a.
