• release number bumped to 8.0.386 by export.pike

• Fix fallout from improved types on ::`[]= and ::_indices

• Web.decode_jwt: Assume JWT if no type set in header.

Fixes decoding of JWTs from Google OpenIDConnect.

• Note about the empty string addition bug.

• mkpackage: Added kludge for [bug 7826].

Make sure that the first string in the mkdirhier loop has the
correct character range by preloading the initial non-empty string.

Needed by the Roxen build system.
