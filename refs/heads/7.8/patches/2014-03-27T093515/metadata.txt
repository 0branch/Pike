  * release number bumped to 851 by export.pike

  * SSL.sslfile: Make sure not to hang on destruct.
    
    The destruct callbac could hang in the local backend when attempting
    to close the connection cleanly. Make sure that the local backend
    doesn't wait for I/O completion in this case.
    
    Fixes [bug 7066].
