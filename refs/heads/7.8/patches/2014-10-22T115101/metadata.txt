Multiple fixes:

  * Image.PNG: Minor change.
    
    Use the proper SET_SVALUE_ macro instead of accessing the fields directly.

  * Image.PNG: Fixed leak of arrays in __decode().

  * Calendar.mkrules: Added some more files to ignore.

  * Updated to tzdata2014h.

  * release number bumped to 892 by export.pike

  * release number bumped to 893 by export.pike

  * _Roxen: Fixed buffer overrun in http_decode_string().
    
    Also increases the strictness of a few related testsuite tests.

  * release number bumped to 894 by export.pike

  * release number bumped to 895 by export.pike

  * SSL.handshake: Support setting the minimum required version.
    
    The SSL 3.0 protocol can now be disabled by setting min_version in
    the context to SSL.Constants.PROTOCOL_TLS_1_0.
    
    Backported API from Pike 8.0. Note that the constants differ
    from Pike 8.0 and later, so use the provided symbolic values.

  * SSL.Constants: Make the PROTOCOL_* constants forward compatible.
    
    As these values have a tendency to get stuck in configuration files
    and the like, make sure that they are forward-compatible with Pike 8.0.
