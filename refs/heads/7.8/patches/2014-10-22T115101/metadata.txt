Multiple fixes:

  * Calendar.mkrules: Added some more files to ignore.

  * Updated to tzdata2014h.

  * SSL.handshake: Support setting the minimum required version.
    
    The SSL 3.0 protocol can now be disabled by setting min_version in
    the context to SSL.Constants.PROTOCOL_TLS_1_0.
    
    Backported API from Pike 8.0. Note that the constants differ
    from Pike 8.0 and later, so use the provided symbolic values.

  * SSL.Constants: Make the PROTOCOL_* constants forward compatible.
    
    As these values have a tendency to get stuck in configuration files
    and the like, make sure that they are forward-compatible with Pike 8.0.
