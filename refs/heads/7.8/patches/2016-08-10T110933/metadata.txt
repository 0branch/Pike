  * Threads.Condition: Potential fix for double free.
    
    In some circumstances there can appear mutex keys that lock
    mutexes that have already been freed. One potential case
    creating such mutexkeys is when the mutex has been destructed
    while being used in a cond wait.
    
    Throw an error instead of locking the freed mutex in the above case.

  * Make the Pike SSL code work with APNS push server which uses client certificates.
