    COMPAT WARNING:
      Attribute namespaces starting with "xml" (except for "xmlns")
      are now handled just like any other attribute namespaces. This
      means that eg the attribute "xml:lang" will be expanded to
      "http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespacelang" in the mapping
      returned by get_attributes(), and not kept as "xml:lang" when
      namespace handling is enabled.
