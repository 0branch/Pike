Multiple fixes:

  * release number bumped to 868 by export.pike

  * release number bumped to 869 by export.pike

  * ZXID: Fixed warning about redefined symbol.
    
    GETTIMEOFDAY is defined in both port.h and <zxid/errmac.h>.
    We don't use either in the ZXID module, so just undef the
    first definition.

  * release number bumped to 870 by export.pike

  * release number bumped to 871 by export.pike

  * Updated to tzdata2014e.
