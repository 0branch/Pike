Multiple fixes:

  * release number bumped to 910 by export.pike

  * release number bumped to 911 by export.pike

  * Handle read errors in Protocols.LysKOM.Raw.
    
    If there is a network outage, con->read() will return 0 (not the empty
    string) after a (long) while.  Treat that properly by calling
    connection_lost() in that case as well.
    
    Fixed a backrace in conwrite by returning 0 if the connection
    is closed.
    
    (cherry picked from commit 7cdea47d8c28017dbdbff49607c811ca0472000c)

  * release number bumped to 912 by export.pike

  * release number bumped to 913 by export.pike

  * Protocols.LDAP: Attempt to pin connections to the same server.
    
    When using replication and DNS-round-robin for LDAP, it is common that
    the servers in the rotation aren't 100% identical, so attempt to have
    successive connections go to the same LDAP server if possible, otherwise
    higher level protocols (eg incremental updates) may be broken.
    
    Fixes [bug 7406].
    
    Also improves support for IPv6.
