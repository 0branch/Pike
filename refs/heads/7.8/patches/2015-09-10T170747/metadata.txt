Multiple fixes:

  * ADT.Heap: Added ADT.Heap.Element.
    
    This adds one level of indirection, but is needed to get a
    reasonable performance in code that needs to call adjust().
    
    Also corresponding updates to ADT.Priority_queue.
    
    Also removes the LFUN::`==() operator from ADT.Priority_queue.elem,
    as it doesn't serve any purpose.
