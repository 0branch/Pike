Multiple fixes:

  * Tools.*.features: Fixed some feature checks.
    
    Adds "Crypto.AES.GCM" and "Crypto.ECC.Curve" to Tools.Install.features.
    
    Replaces the check for (the nonexistant) "Crypto.GCM" with "Crypto.AES.GCM"
    in Tools.Standalone.features.

  * Tools.Install: Accept constant-less programs as existing.
    
    Fixes detection of Crypto.ECC.Curve in features().

  * Protocols.LDAP: Support passing an SSL.Context to get_connection().
    
    Sometimes the default SSL.Context isn't appropriate, so support
    passing a custom one along to Protocols.LDAP.client().
