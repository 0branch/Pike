Multiple fixes:

  * Protocols.HTTP.Query: Support async keep-alive.
    
    If a Protocols.HTTP.Query instance is used with a keep-alive connection,
    async_request fails if the remote end closed the connection.
    
    Fixes [bug 7143].

  * Backend: Fixed stale thread state in poll devices.
    
    The current thread was left swapped in during co_wait_interpreter()
    in POLL_DEVICE_SET_EVENTS().
    
    Also fixes condition variable leak (probably not relevant in most
    thread implementations, but...).

  * Stdio.cp: Detect ouroboros.
    
    Copying a directory to a subdirectory of itself would often trigger an
    infinite loop.
    
    Copying a directory to itself could trigger truncation of the files.
    
    Note that it's still possible to trigger this behaviour by using symlinks.
    
    Also fixes recursive_mv(), which either hanged in cp() as above, or
    deleted all the files if cp() succeeded in the above cases.

  * CHANGES: updates for new 7.8 build.

  * release number bumped to 866 by export.pike

  * release number bumped to 867 by export.pike
