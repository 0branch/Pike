  * Crypto.RandomString: Reduce entropy waste.
    
    random_string() used to want as much entropy added as was extracted.
    This had a tendency to cause frequent (expensive) reseeding for no
    good reason. This patch changes the entropy estimates, and speeds up
    random_string() about a factor 200.
