• Protocols.HTTP.do_async_proxied_method: Fix timeout handling.

  The HTTP timeout was lost during TLS negotiation.

  Fixes [PIKE-7].

• Protocols.HTTP.Query: Added {init,remove}_async_timeout().

  Some code clean up in preparation for fixing [PIKE-7].

• Protocols.HTTP: Support connecting to proxies via https.

• SSL.context: Reduce default cipher strength requirement to 112.

  There are still some servers in the wild that require DES3 when
  there's no support for elliptic curves.
