Pike 8.1: Changes since Pike 8.0 (scratch area for future release notes)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

New language features
---------------------

o Unlimited character constant size.

  There is no longer any limit to the size of character constants,
  e.g. 'acdefghijk' creates the bignum 0x61636465666768696a6b.

Incompatible changes
--------------------

o Gz.crc32 now only returns positive results.

Removed features and modules
----------------------------

o Compatibility for Pike versions before 7.8 is no longer available.

o GTK1 library is deprected, so glue code is removed.

C-level API changes
-------------------

o The contract for functions is now changed so that a function is no
  longer required to clean the stack. The topmost value of the stack
  will be regarded as the return value and the rest of the items on
  the stack, compared to before the function arguments were pushed,
  will be popped and discarded. Efuns still have to clean their stack
  as previously.

Building and installing
-----------------------

o GMP 4.1 or later is now required.
